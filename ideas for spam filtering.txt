Idea for spam filtering

features
1.) bigrams -- to help be better //lowercase + no punctuation
2.) word length -- does this mean anything 
3.) unigram words in all caps
4.) from section, separate from email into username, website, and extension
5.) multiple punctuation in a row (number of times multiple punctuation in a row appears in an email)


** classify will take a dictionary for each feature and have a function to calculate the score for each given feature dictionary and then compile all the scores

tokenizing
1.) extract from:, and subject: [down]
2.) change numbers in subject to JSNUM6, JSNUM3, or just JSNUM
3.) change websites into the word website (if they start with http or www)
4.) if we see a dollar sign change to JSMONEY
5.) separate symbols from chars but not from other symbols
